        <h3>Premise</h3>
        <p>A young noble Rishe Weitzner has had her engagement to the crown prince annulled, but this is the seventh time it's happened; she's stuck within a time loop, where no matter the job she takes or location, she always ends up dead at 20, five years after the annulment. This time she catches the eye of Prince Arnold of the neighboring Galkhein Kingdom, which was the source of a world war, pestilence, resource depletion, and even direct murder in all her previous loops.

          Although wary and resentful towards Arnold, Rishe accepts his proposal of marriage on the condition she doesn't have to perform royal duties, and gets to loaf around; also helps Arnold, as she fulfills his father's request to "technically" take a foreign fiancée/hostage. However, she soon starts using all her past life skills to help out the people of the Galkhein Kingdom and sees Arnold is not the same cold person as in her 6th loop; making Rishe wonder what made Arnold's heart grow cold.
